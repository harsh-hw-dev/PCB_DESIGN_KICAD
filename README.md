## 📘 Overview
This repository contains a **PCB Design Project developed using KiCad**, an open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software.  
It demonstrates the **complete design workflow** — from schematic capture and PCB layout to 3D visualization and fabrication output.  

This project is ideal for **students, hardware developers, and embedded engineers** who want to explore PCB design and documentation practices.

## ⚙️ Features
- 🧩 Complete **schematic** and **PCB layout** design in KiCad  
- 📄 Includes **BOM (Bill of Materials)**  
- 🧱 Ready-to-fabricate **Gerber** and **drill** files  
- 🔍 Clear net labeling and signal routing  
- ⚡ Optimized trace widths and ground plane for signal integrity  
- 🧠 3D view of the board and components  
- 🧰 Modular folder structure for easy reference
